# 🧭 Top Navigation Redesign (Glassmorphism)
## ✨ Floating & Modern
I have completely transformed the Top Navigation into a **floating glass-morphism** element.
- **Floating Bar**: Detached from the top with `margin: 16px 24px` and rounded corners (`20px`).
- **Glass Effect**: `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` creates a premium frosted look.
- **Search Pill**: Input field is now a "pill" shape (`border-radius: 50px`) that expands on focus.
- **Circular Icons**: Action buttons are now perfect circles with a refined hover lift and Indigo tint.
- **Profile Pill**: User profile is encapsulated in a rounded pill shape with a clear border definition on hover.

This redesign aligns with the "New Project" requested aesthetic of premium, dynamic, and attractive UI.
